### ROS Installation Tips

**which distribution to Install?**
  - visit http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials
  - consider a version which supports LTS(Long Time Support) avoid version which dont have long time support
  - Lunar doesn't have LTS while Kinetic, Indigo and Melodic have long time support. so choose wisely according to your need
  - It is suggested to install Kinetic However It is old as compared to Melodic as it contains lots of packages.
  - If you want to go for Melodic, go for it as it is newly released and will have LTS

 - Every version of ROS it works on specific version of Ubuntu.
 - ROS (Melodic) is only supported on Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic) release.

**Where to Install ROS?**
  - you can have installation of ROS on either 
    * on a physical machine 
        * the problem here is, because of any kind of reason your system crashes, stopped working and  gets damaged. 
        * This requires reinstallation of the whole system which might be a tedious task to do so and also very time consuming. 
        * So instead of installing on a physical machine, *We recommend you to install on a Virtual Machine.*
    * or on a Virtual Machine
        * we recommend using virtual machine for working on ROS.
